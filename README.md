# The-Enron-Scandal
A fraud detection project using text data

This is the second fraud detection project I am working on and this time, I will analyze text data in form of emails.

The goals of this project is to create a list of fraudulent terms that helps us to detect fraudulent and non-fraudulent behaviour in the emails. I will use 2 different methods: the manual one and the The natural language processing approach.

ðŸ“ˆ **Data**: we will use the dataset (Credit Card Fraud Detection) from Kaggle. 
the database consists of 284.807 transactions made by credit card in two different days in September 2013, where only 492 of them are marked as fraud. All variables are numeric, and features from "V1" to "V28" are the result of PCA transformation. Only two feautures were not transformed with PCA: "Time" and "Amount". The feature "Class" is our target variable and it has two possible values:
<ul>
  <li>1= fraud</li>
  <li>0= non-fraud</li>
</ul>

ðŸ”¬ **Methodology**: Python is the primary tool for the data analysis and visualization. Morever, Github shall be used for Project management.
