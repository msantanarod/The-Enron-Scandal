# The Enron Scandal - A Fraud Detection Project Using Text Data

This is the second fraud detection project I am working on, and this time, I will analyze text data from emails.

The goal of this project is to create a list of fraudulent terms that helps us to detect fraudulent and non-fraudulent behaviors in the emails. I will use 2 different methods: manual one and the natural language processing (NLP).

ðŸ“ˆ **Data**: I will use the dataset [The Enron Email](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wcukierski/enron-email-dataset) from Kaggle.

The Enron case is one of the biggest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history(for more info: [The Enron Scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal).

This dataset contains approximately 500,000 emails generated by employees of the Enron Corporation. It was obtained by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation of Enron's collapse. 

ðŸ”¬ **Methodology**: Python is the primary tool for the data analysis and visualization. Morever, Github shall be used for Project management.
