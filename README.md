# The Enron Scandal - A Fraud Detection Project Using Text Data

This is the second fraud detection project I am working on and this time, I will analyze text data in form of emails.

The goals of this project is to create a list of fraudulent terms that helps us to detect fraudulent and non-fraudulent behaviour in the emails. I will use 2 different methods: the manual one and the natural language processing approach.

ðŸ“ˆ **Data**: I will use the dataset The Enron Email Dataset from Kaggle.
This dataset contains approximately 500,000 emails generated by employees of the Enron Corporation. It was obtained by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation of Enron's collapse. 

ðŸ”¬ **Methodology**: Python is the primary tool for the data analysis and visualization. Morever, Github shall be used for Project management.
